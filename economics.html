    <h1>Economics</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Introduction to Economics</h2>
    <p>
        Economics is a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. 
        It analyzes how individuals, businesses, and governments make choices to allocate scarce resources to satisfy 
        unlimited wants and needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        At its core, economics is concerned with the study of how societies utilize resources to produce various goods and services 
        and how they distribute and consume those products. It examines the interactions between individuals, businesses, and governments, 
        as well as the broader impact of economic activities on society.
    </p>
    <p>
        The field of economics is divided into two major branches: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on the behavior 
        of individual consumers, households, and firms, exploring topics such as supply and demand, market competition, consumer decision-making, 
        and the pricing of goods and services. Macroeconomics, on the other hand, looks at the broader picture of the entire economy, including 
        factors such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and international trade.
    </p>
    <p>
        Economists use various tools and techniques, including mathematical models, statistical analysis, and empirical research, to study economic 
        phenomena and make predictions about future trends. They also develop theories and frameworks to understand the complexities of economic systems 
        and guide policy decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Economics has applications in numerous fields, such as finance, business, public policy, international relations, and development studies. 
        It provides valuable insights into how societies allocate resources, create wealth, and address societal challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, economics plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the world's economic systems and helps inform decision-making at individual, 
        organizational, and governmental levels.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Economics</h2>
    <p>
        Microeconomics: Microeconomics studies the behavior of individual economic agents, such as households, consumers, and firms. It examines how individuals 
        make decisions regarding the allocation of resources, the interaction between supply and demand in specific markets, and the determination of prices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Macroeconomics: Macroeconomics deals with the overall performance and behavior of an entire economy. It analyzes aggregate variables such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product), 
        inflation, unemployment, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and economic growth. Macroeconomists study the factors influencing these variables and the interrelationships 
        between different sectors of the economy.
    </p>
    <p>
        International Economics: This branch of economics focuses on trade and financial interactions between countries. It examines international trade patterns, exchange rates, 
        balance of payments, globalization, international investment, and the effects of trade policies on economies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Development Economics: Development economics explores the factors that contribute to economic growth and development, particularly in low-income countries. It addresses issues 
        such as poverty, inequality, education, healthcare, infrastructure, foreign aid, and sustainable development. Development economists study policies and strategies to promote economic 
        progress and improve living standards in developing nations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Behavioral Economics: Behavioral economics combines insights from psychology and economics to understand how individuals make economic decisions. It recognizes that people's choices 
        are influenced by cognitive biases, emotions, social factors, and other non-rational factors. Behavioral economics aims to provide a more realistic understanding of human behavior and decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
        Environmental Economics: Environmental economics focuses on the relationship between the economy and the environment. It analyzes the economic impact of environmental policies, such as pollution control, 
        resource conservation, and climate change mitigation. Environmental economists explore ways to internalize environmental costs into economic decision-making and promote sustainable development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Public Economics: Public economics studies the role of the government in the economy. It examines how governments raise revenue through taxation and allocate resources to provide public goods and services. 
        Public economists analyze the efficiency and equity implications of public policies, including taxation, public expenditure, welfare programs, and regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are just a few examples of the different types of economics. There are also specialized areas within economics, such as labor economics, financial economics, health economics, and industrial organization, 
        that delve into specific sectors or aspects of the economy.
    </p>

    <h2>3 Major Theories of Economics</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Keynesian economics</li>
        <p>
            Keynesian Economics: Proposed by John Maynard Keynes, Keynesian economics emerged in response to the Great Depression. It advocates for active government intervention in the economy to manage aggregate demand 
            and stabilize economic fluctuations. Keynesians argue that during recessions, the government should increase spending and use monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment.
        </p>
        <li>Neoclassical economics</li>
        <p>
            Neoclassical Economics: Neoclassical economics builds upon classical economics but incorporates mathematical models and marginal analysis. It emphasizes individual rational decision-making and the concept of equilibrium. 
            Neoclassical economists focus on the efficient allocation of resources, the role of prices in coordinating economic activity, and the efficiency of competitive markets.
        </p>
        <li>Marxian economics</li>
        <p>
            Marxian economics, also known as Marxist economics or the economics of Karl Marx, is a socio-economic framework based on the works of the 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx. It provides a critical analysis 
            of capitalism and seeks to understand the dynamics of capitalist economies, class struggle, and the potential for societal transformation.
